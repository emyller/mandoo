utm is a JavaScript library that focuses on flexibility and simplicity. It provides the most basic JS functionalities (like Ajax, animations, DOM manipulation, event handling, etc) as much as a powerful module system, that can be used as an application platform with the User Interface add-ins.


# Downloading

You can get utm by downloading the latest development version from the git repo: see http://github.com/emyller/utm/ or a stable version at http://utmproject.org/main/#download


# Installing

After download and copy the library to your web project, put the utm core (generally utm.js or some minified version) on your page. Be careful when changing the src attribute.
Just that.
If you don't care about the utm source, just add a minified version to your page, it will improve the download speed of the script.


# Using

We're still writing the utm documentation and manuals at http://utmproject.org/wiki/. For now, get support by contacting us directly (see section 'Contributing' below). I apologize that! But at least, you can get human help. =]


# Contributing

Thanks for reading this section! I'd be so glad if you could get involved into our project, helping us to build the fastest, full featured, most useful and easiest to use library. And we need a special attention to documentation...
For anything you want about utm, you can contact me (data above). Thank you!
