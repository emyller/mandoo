# Mandoo JavaScript Library

[Mandoo](http://mandoojs.com/ "The Mandoo project home") gives you a very simple way to do all the tasks - even the complex ones - in your page / web application.

## Why?
We love the simplest and cleanest way to do things we want. We also want it organized, we hate code macaronics. We don't like to mess markup (HTML) with our JavaScript code. We want a simpler way to extend our functionality, enough of dozens of extra tags in our code. We want *power*, *easiness*, *flexibility* and *organization* together, in a **lightweight** piece of software. Oh, agree with us? Do you want it too? Keep reading. ;)

## Features
* a complete **Animation** engine
* a helpful **modularization** system
* a very flexible **DOM API**
* event-based **Ajax** functions
* standized normal/custom **events**
* native CSS3 selectors support ([Sizzle](http://sizzlejs.com/))
* **class** abstraction
* more basic but useful functions

## Using
After downloading Mandoo, just add its core (`mandoo.js` or its compressed version, `mandoo.mini.js`) **to the bottom** of your page (right before `</body>`):
	<script type="text/javascript" src="mandoo/mandoo.js"></script>
That's all, you're done.

### Inserting plug-ins (modules)
You don't need to care about css/javascript files to include in your markup. Keep it all simpler:
	u.require('modulename', 'othermodule');
Just import the module you want in your .js file. Yes, you're done.

## Extending
Want to write a Mandoo module? Great, that's so easy. [Learn about it](http://mandoojs.com/guides/extending).
