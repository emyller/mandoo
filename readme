utm is a JavaScript library that focuses on flexibility and simplicity. It provides the most basic JS functionalities (like Ajax, animations, DOM manipulation, event handling, etc) as much as a powerful module system, that can be used as an application platform with the User Interface add-ins.


>>> Downloading:

You can get utm by downloading the latest development version from the git repo: see http://github.com/emyller/utm/ or a stable version at http://utmproject.org/download/


>>> Installing:

After download and copy the library to your web project, put the utm core (generally utm.js or some minified version) on your page. Be careful when changing the src attribute.
Just that.
If you don't care about the utm source, just add a minified version to your page, it will improve the download speed of the script.


>>> Using:

I'm still writing the utm docs and a system to organize them (need help for that). For now, get support by contacting me (see section 'Contributing' below). I apologize that! But at least, you can get human help. =]


>>> Note:

This project is not in a final version yet. It's just a development version, but it was tested on the mainly used browsers, with no bugs, so far.


>>> Contributing
Thanks for reading this section! I'd be so glad if you could get involved into our project, helping us to build the fastest, full featured, most useful and easiest to use library. And we need a special attention to docs system...
For anything you want about utm, you can contact me (data above). Thank you!
